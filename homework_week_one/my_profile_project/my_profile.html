	<p>My Name is Mike Yencha.</p>
	<p>I'm a classically trained artist who started doing code almost by accident.  Working for a company who needed marketing design support, I informed then I would like to learn code.  I thought I would get direct training before starting, however, they had different ideas.  One morning when I walked into work I was informed that in a week I'd be sitting on-site.  In a week I went to <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank"> Lynda.com </a> and began taking HTML and CSS classes.  I give <a href="https://www.lynda.com/James-Williamson/128-1.html" target="_blank">James Williamson</a> complete credit for giving me the basics I needed to get started.  I must also thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlene-slayton-24352520/" target="_blank">Charlene Slayton</a> for teaching me the practicalities of surviving the development environment.</p>
	<p>I'm a graphics designer who has been doing HTML and CSS for a large government project for 5 years.  But I'm interested in learning more and expading my horizons into development</p>
